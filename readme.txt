== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Shortcodes available =

You can lock parts of code in posts, pages and widget with these shortcode:
`[cookie] ... [/cookie]`
Parameters:
`[cookie height="100px" width="100%" text="Hi <b>WordPress</b>"] //My code [/cookie]`

To display a box (in pages/posts) with ability to revoke consent (if cookies accepted) or accept cookies (if not done yet):
`[cookie-control]`

= PHP Functions available =
You can easily verify if cookies consent has been set with:
`if ( function_exists('cookie_accepted') && cookie_accepted() ) {
    // Your code
}`
However this will limit to not showing the wrapped code. If you want to display a box like when using `[cookie]` shortcode, in  php you have:
`generate_cookie_notice($height, $width);
generate_cookie_notice_text($height, $width, $text);`

If you think that we should provide more shortcodes, functions, or enhance what we already provide, please let us know in [our forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/eu-cookie-law).
